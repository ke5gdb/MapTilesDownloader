**A super easy to use GUI for downloading map tiles**

## So what does it do?

This tiny python based script allows you to download map tiles from Google, Bing, Open Street Maps, ESRI, NASA, and other providers. This script comes with an easy to use web based map UI for selecting the area and previewing tiles.

## Run with Docker

To run MapTilesDownloader temporarily so you can load maps before a chase, run this command and navigate to port 5002.

```console
docker run \
  -t \
  --name maptilesdownloader \
  --network=host \
  -v ~/Maps/:/opt/MapTilesDownloader/output/ \
  ghcr.io/ke5gdb/maptilesdownloader:latest
```

To launch MapsTileDownloader on every boot, run:

```console
docker run \
  -d \
  -t \
  --restart=always \
  --name maptilesdownloader \
  --network=host \
  -v ~/Maps/:/opt/MapTilesDownloader/output/ \
  ghcr.io/ke5gdb/maptilesdownloader:latest
```

Sample `docker-compose.yml` instance:
```
services:
  maptilesdownloader:
    image: ghcr.io/ke5gdb/maptilesdownloader:latest
    restart: 'always'
    network_mode: host
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - ~/Maps/:/opt/MapTilesDownloader/output/
```

## Installation on Raspberry Pi for use with chasemapper
```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip libopenjp2-7-dev libtiff5 python3-pillow
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/Moll1989/MapTilesDownloader
```

If your username is not the default 'pi' then you must edit the systemd unit configuration in `~/MapTilesDownloader/maptilesdownloader.service` and replace all references to `/home/pi/` with `/home/USER/` where USER is your username.

```sh
sudo mv MapTilesDownloader/maptilesdownloader.service /etc/systemd/system/maptilesdownloader.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/maptilesdownloader.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable maptilesdownloader
sudo systemctl start maptilesdownloader
ln -s /home/$(whoami)/MapTilesDownloader/src/output /home/$(whoami)/Maps
```

Then open up the device you use for viewing chasemapper and navigate to port 5002 instead of 5001.

The output map tiles will be in the `~/MapTilesDownloader/src/output` directory.  However, we have created a symbolic link to `~/Maps` which is the default map tile location for chasemapper.  When configuring chasemapper.cfg, ensure that `tile_server_path` is set to `/home/USER/Maps`, where USER is your username (eg. pi).

## Requirements

Needs **Python 3.0+**, [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) library, libopenjp2-7-dev, libtiff5 and a modern web browser. 

## Purpose

This fork has been customised to be suitable for running alongside chasemapper on a Raspberry Pi.  This makes it really easy to jump on and download maps before going on a balloon chase.

## Important Disclaimer

Downloading map tiles is subject to the terms and conditions of the tile provider. Some providers such as Google Maps have restrictions in place to avoid abuse, therefore before downloading any tiles make sure you understand their TOCs. I recommend not using Google, Bing, and ESRI tiles in any commercial application without their consent.
